I haven't had a chance to write in reflection about my internship at [Neoteric Design]() yet, although i've already written a few posts for them that are live on their blog [here](). 

Last winter I set out with a task of finding an internship for the summer. It was a long process, I redesigned my portfolio site for the application process, which was very hard to ship because [I didn't feel like it lived up to my full potential](). 


Once I felt it was polished enough, I started the lengthy process of finding web development firms in Chicago. I used sites like [Agency Pimp]() later in the process, but I started by simply googling "web development chicago" and writing down ones with potential. I found Neoteric Design on page 10 and they were by far the most impressive.

A full stack Ruby on Rails studio located [just north of the river](), they only had four employees at the time (and still do). I recognized this as the perfect opportunity to learn from a small dedicated team of developers, but it became so much more than that.
