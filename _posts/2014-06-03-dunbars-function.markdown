title: Dunbar's Function
---
Dunbar is a sociologist who was interested in the brain activity of primates compared to that of modern humans. He found that prehistoric farming communities tend to remain in groups of 150 people. Likewise for hunters and gatherers, which would travel in groups of 50, because it was hard to control each other past that point. He used these studies to determine the optimal number of people that can remain effective in a group is between 50-150 people, which then became known as "Dunbar's Number."

This number is still effective in modern day. A lot of online communities, such as World of Warcraft, cap their guild membership at 50 players. Likewise a company of one hundred fifty ends up wasting a lot of it's time and money by managing their team.

Controlling group sizes is extremely relevant to the "startup" world that we live in today. Five to eight employees is the optimal number of people for a small community; enough to supervise each other, voice their opinion, and contribute to the whole. Any less than that and the group becomes clique-y, any more than that and meetings become long, boring, frusterating, and unbearable. Companies with over 12 employees start to break off and form some sort of management, but this does not become effective until at least 25 people.

This study suggests that the optimal number of employees is around 7 for small groups and around 60 for established companies. By the time the corperation reaches 150 (Dunbar's Number), major fragmentation must occur.

Obviously we don't live in a world of 150 people. There are 6-7 billion people on earth and that number is only growing. This has a large effect on how we communicate and manage each other everyday.

Lets say you work for a major corperation. Do you communicate with the CEO personally? Obviously not, you probably have never even met him. Even so there are plenty of rules and decisions passed down the line that have a direct impact on your life.

Likewise for politics. Most of us have never met our president, but we live constantly under his established rules and regulations which we have had no influence in creating. Even more interesting is that we insist on arguing over issues that we have little to no influence in. This could be our primal need to effect the tribe mentality, which is much more effective at Dunbar's Number.
